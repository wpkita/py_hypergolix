Some thoughts:

Misc extras: 
    + More likely than not, all persistence remotes should also use a 
        single autoresponder, through the salmonator. Salmonator should
        then be moved into hypergolix.remotes instead of .persistence.
    + At least for now, applications must ephemerally declare themselves
        capable of supporting a given API. Note, once again, that these
        api_id registrations ONLY APPLY TO UNSOLICITED OBJECT SHARES!
    
It'd be nice to remove the msgpack dependency in utils.IPCPackerMixIn.
    + Could use very simple serialization instead.
    + Very heavyweight for such a silly thing.
    + It would take very little time to remove.
    + This should wait until we have a different serialization for all
        of the core bootstrapping _GAOs. This, in turn, should wait 
        until after SmartyParse is converted to be async.
        
IPC Apps should not have access to objects that are not _Dispatchable.
    + Yes, this introduces some overhead. Currently, it isn't the most
        efficient abstraction.
    + Non-dispatchable objects are inherently un-sharable. That's the
        most fundamental issue here.
    + Note that private objects are also un-sharable, so they should be
        able to bypass some overhead in the future (see below)
    + Future effort will focus on making the "dispatchable" wrapper as
        efficient an abstraction as possible.
    + This basically makes a judgement call that everything should be
        sharable.

    AppObj instances will wrap their state in a dispatch structure 
    before updating golix containers.
    
    Can be initiated directly using a reference to an embed. May also be
    constructed from _EmbedBase.new_object.
    
    Everything here is wrapped from the messagepack dispatch format, so
    state may be more than just bytes.
    
    Unlike RawObj instances, AppObj instances are meant to be used with
    a specific API definition, and/or a specific token. Tokens can be 
    used to provide a consistent PRIVATE, freeform application state,
    whilst any objects that are being communicated to a different agent
    must use api ids.
    
    Basically, token-based AppObj instances without an api_id represent
    data that will not be shared. It can, however, be any unstructured
    data.
    
    _private isinstance bool
        if True, dispatch by token.
        if False, dispatch by api id.
        
    Note: AppObj should be set up such that there is exactly one AppObj
    per application. As such, they should probably be aware of their 
    endpoints.
    
    Note: Todo: Add some kind of automatic garbage collection mechanism
    such that, when gc'd because, for example, it is only defined within
    the scope of an AppObj state (as when linking between dynamic 
    objects), we don't continue to get updates for an object that we no
    longer retain.
